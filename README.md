# TuxCalculator

*TuxCalculator* is a powerful text-based calculator.
That means, expressions are typed in as text and then evaluated to give a result.

*TuxCalculator* is written in Scala and runs on Desktop as well as Android.
It can use either GTK (through [java-gnome](https://java-gnome.sourceforge.net/)) or Swing or run entirely text based.

To get started, head over to [Releases](https://github.com/noeppi-noeppi/TuxCalculator/releases).
There you can download the *fatjar* for desktop or the *apk* file to install on an Android phone.
There is also a manual that explains TuxCalculator in detail.
